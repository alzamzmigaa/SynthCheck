# ShapeCheck: Knowledge-based method for detecting network-induced shape artifacts
This work introduces a knowledge-based method for detecting network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic images. The method is model-agnostic, interpretable, and efficiently identifies images with unrealistic anatomical shapes.

The code, along with detailed documentation for this method, will be made available for public use.
